    "This past year I got married, and it was a [blast](https://www.flickr.com/gp/146306741@N04/kifqtW). After months and months of planning, we lucked out and nothing major went wrong on the day of (despite some last minute rain forecasts for our outdoor venue). During the planning process, we ran into all of the usual challenges. To make matters worse, I was living in CA at the time while my fiancée was in NJ, and we were both busy with school (astrophysics Ph.D. for me, M.D. for her). Unsurprisingly, we looked for every opportunity to make the planning easier. As one example, I made an automated, online RSVP system for our wedding website. After some initial set-up, we were able to sit back and watch our master guest list (stored on our Google Drive) track the RSVP responses of our guests. And better yet, the whole thing was free. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are a lot of options out there for online RSVP forms, but nearly all of them charge some sort of fee. So, I ended up combining a bunch of free services, and using some Python to glue them together, to build our RSVP system. In this post, I'm going to outline the main steps involved in the hope that it might make wedding planning just a bit easier for some future couple. \n",

    "## Using the JotForm service\n",
    "\n",
    "To start, we need to set up the online form. There are a lot of options. My wife and I ended up choosing [JotForm](https://www.jotform.com). When setting out to find the right service, we had a couple of constraints in mind. First, we wanted it to be free. Second, the form needed to be able to support conditional logic, e.g., the ability to show specific fields based on the name input by the guest. This was crucial for us, as we wanted to be able to tailor the RSVP form for those guests with and without plus ones. And finally, we needed to be able to output the form submissions to Google Drive since my wife and I maintained our master guest list as a Google doc spreadsheet. JotForm meets all of these requirements (and offers a nice user experience to boot!). \n",
    "\n",
    "JotForm has a free tier with 100 form submissions, and it offers several ways to increase that limit (e.g., social media follows, etc). We ended up with 200 form submissions for free, which was more than enough for us. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's dive into the form. We'll use some Star Wars inspired names to explore the available functionality. Try entering \"Luke Skywalker\" into the form below, and watch the yes/no RSVP options appear. Now, try entering \"Leia\" into the first name box. Not only will the entry for Leia appear but also the entry for her plus one (Han Solo). Using these two types of entries, we were able to support guest RSVPs with and without accompanying plus ones. JotForm allows a lot of customization regarding the condition logic. For example, you can set up the form so guests can also use the plus one's name — try inputing \"Han\" into the first name box."

    "So, after creating a new form on JotForm, we added a new entry block to the form for each guest on our guest list and attached conditional logic to each such that the correct options were shown when the \"First Name\" and \"Last Name\" fields were filled in. Since we had roughly 150 invited guests, this was by far the most time consuming step of this whole process. I didn't find any good way of automating this step, but that would be worth exploring if you happened to have many more invited guests than we did. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, JotForm allows you to link the form to your Google account, and will output the submission to a spreadsheet in your Google Drive. Unfortunately, the conditional logic used above makes the output table nearly unreadable. Each row in the spreadsheet corresponds to a different submission, and each column corresponds to a guest's name. With hundreds of invited guests, there are a lot of empty cells in need of consolidation. More on this in the next section."

    "## Formatting the JotForm submissions with Python\n",
    "\n",
    "To overcome the deficiencies of the JotForm output format, I wrote a short Python script to grab the Google spreadsheet output by JotForm, clean and re-format the submissions, and re-upload the results to our own master guest list. The code can be [found on my GitHub](https://github.com/nickhand/automated-wedding-rsvps). It relies on a handy little software package called [``df2gspread``](http://df2gspread.readthedocs.io) that makes managing Google spreadsheets in Python particularly easy using [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/). To get started, you'll need to setup your Google API credentials in order to query Google Drive from Python. The process is straightforward, and instructions can be found [here](http://df2gspread.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html#access-credentials).\n",

    "Let's take a look at the format of the Google spreadsheet output by JotForm. The spreadsheet is available for browsing [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_hoBn8_0U9kurUFrr3sv6HAR_TCt2GlRL547G4ZZI7w/edit?usp=sharing). We'll load the spreadsheet into a pandas DataFrame using the unique identifier assigned to every Google spreadsheet (the long string of numbers and letters in the spreadsheet URL). "

    "Managing the guest list for a wedding is notoriously difficult. After a few iterations, my wife and I found a system that worked for us. We created a \"master\" guest list using a spreadsheet on Google Drive that not only included guest names but also added \"Expected RSVP\" and \"Actual RSVP\" columns. We then used our Python script to update the \"Actual RSVP\" column. As RSVPs started to roll in, this format allowed us to quickly see how realistic our total guest count estimate was (and update our vendors accordingly). \n",

Even better, the Python script only updates the individual cells of the \"Actual RSVP\" column (column D above) for those guests who RSVP'ed online. So, if you are like us, and have to use traditional hard-copy RSVPs for some of your guests, you'll be able to manually update the \"Actual RSVP\" column for those guests without losing that information.\n",

    "4. Copy the \"master\" guest list spreadsheet template (available [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1iEAfk1cVG_PwhcwKJxUeLycUIsRhsAsp9e4xCk2qLtM)) to your own Google Drive, and input your guest list on the \"RSVP List\" sheet. Take note of the unique identifier of the cloned spreadsheet. \n",
    "5. Setup Google Drive API credentials, following the instructions [here](http://df2gspread.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html#access-credentials).\n",
    "6. Download the ``compute_rsvps.py`` script from [my GitHub](https://github.com/nickhand/automated-wedding-rsvps), and make sure the dependencies are also installed (following the README on my GitHub).\n",
    "7. At the bottom of the ``compute_rsvps.py`` script, update the \"YES\" and \"NO\" variables with the RSVP messages you used on your form. Also, update the \"JOTFORM\" variable with the identifier of the spreadsheet output by JotForm (see step #3), and update the \"UPLOAD\" variable with the identifier of the final spreadsheet that holds the master guest list (see step #4). \n",
