<!-- PELICAN_BEGIN_SUMMARY -->

Hello, and welcome to Offhand Remarks! I'm Nick Hand. Let me start off by
apologizing for the terrible pun in the title of this blog.
I'm a recent astrophysics Ph.D. grad from Berkeley who is currently living in
Philadelphia looking for data science jobs. My Ph.D. focused on improving the tools that
astronomers use to analyze data sets that map the three-dimensional Universe
on its largest scales ([this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08LBltePDZw)
is a great visualization of one of these data sets). My studies offered me a
chance to use Python and open-source software every day and helped teach me
the power of data and statistics for offering insights into complex questions.
As a cosmology Ph.D., I was essentially a data scientist tasked with extracting
insight from the Universe itself. I am the lead developer of one
[open-source, cosmology Python toolkit](https://github.com/bccp/nbodykit)
and have contributed to several other open-source Python projects.

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

I'm passionate about open science and open-source software, and
am excited about using data science and machine learning
to help improve people's daily lives. I'm particularly
interested in healthcare-related data science projects â€” both my wife and
brother are Emergency Medicine doctors in Philadelphia.
Now that my Ph.D. is over, I've finally found some
time to start this blog as an outlet for interesting projects and ideas.
Most of the content posted here will be Python-related in
one way or another. It'll include things I worked on (or, more likely, struggled
through) during my Ph.D. studies that I think others might benefit from,
as well as any other side projects I get up to in my free time. I'm also
a big believer in reproducible data analysis, and I'll try to reproduce
here any interesting analyses that I happen to stumble upon.

This is my first foray into blogging, and I've largely followed the example
of Jake Vanderplas (a fellow astronomer!) and his excellent blog,
[Pythonic Perambulations](http://jakevdp.github.io). I've borrowed a lot of the
framework from his blog to get Offhand Remarks up and running. Thanks to
him and [Daniel Rodriguez](https://github.com/danielfrg) for their work
on using Jupyter notebooks with Pelican and for their Pelican theme, which
serves as the basis for the theme of this blog. Their hard work is
very much appreciated!

Welcome, and thanks for reading!
